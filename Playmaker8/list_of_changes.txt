1. Copy the StateActionValueMap to BaseActionValueMap
2. Change StateActionValueMap to empty class which extends from BaseActionValueMap so that we can 
create different algorithm
3. Add public StateActionValue(Percep percep, Action action, double value)  to StateActionValue
4. Change public final Action getBestAction(Percep state) to public Action getBestAction(Percep state) 
in BaseStateActionValueMap (formerlly StateActionValueMap) so that other BaseStateActionValueMap can perform this function.
5. Change the public StateActionValueMap refineStateActionValueMap (ReinforcementLearner tempReinforcementLearner)
 in Agent to allow q-learning to be called
6. Add to GlobalVar to PredatorTester to store argument (for initializing different model at runtime)
